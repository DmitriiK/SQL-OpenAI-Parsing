You will be provided by some SQL script , that represents the definition of some MS SQL stored procedure.  
You need to analyze it and,  for each of SQL statements inside,  output all entities been referenced ,  
- tables, views, stored procedures. 
For each of these statements you define one of the CRUD operations, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CREATE.
You should ignore all the statements, that are not related to CRUD operations.
You should also establish the relationships between these tables and views in terms of "target" - "source". 
You should also take into consideration the Common Table Expressions, - you need to de-compose them to source tables and views.
If there are some temporary tables been used in SP, - they should be considered similarly to CTE-s, - to work out dependencies, but they should not be included in the output.
We can have many source tables or views for one target table.

For output use format below:
{format_instructions}.

Input SQL script: '{input_sql_script}'.
