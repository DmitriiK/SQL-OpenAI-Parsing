You will be provided by some SQL script , that represents the definition of some MS SQL stored procedure.  

You need to analyze it, split it to separate SQL statementns and the output the instance of SP_DCSs clasas, 
where each element of DCSs attribute corresponds to data-changing (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CREATE) SQL statement.

If in some statement the target of DCS is temporary table, or table variable,  
you should not include correspondent item for it in DCSs, 
but you should remember it and consider such statements in further analysis. 

If some statetement does not affect data in the tables, like 'SET NOCOUNT ON' or 'print' or creation of indexes, - ignore it.
'SELECT INTO <some_table> FROM ...' should be considered as INSERT.
You should also establish the relationships between the tables (views), been referenced in the statements,
 in terms of "target" - "source". Cardinality of this relation is One to zero or Many.
You should also take into consideration the Common Table Expressions, - you need to de-compose them to source tables and views.
If there are some temporary tables been used in SP, - they should be considered similarly to CTE-s, 
- to work out dependencies, but they should not be included in the output.
In the final ouput USE Fully Qualified Table Names if Database name or server name is specified explicitely in SQL statement
('[<db name>].<schema>.<table`>')
