You will be provided by some SQL script , that represents the definition of some MS SQL stored procedure.  

You need to analyze it and, and output the list,
where each entity  corresponds to data-changing (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CREATE) SQL statement.
Let's refer to this entity as DCS.
If the target of DCS is temporary table, you should not include this statement to the output list, 
but you should consider these statements in further analysis. 
For each of DCS-s,  output all entities been referenced, - tables, views, stored procedures. 
For each of these statements you define one of the data-changing operations, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CREATE, DROP.
You should not produce more than one DCS for each SQL statements in the text. 
Thus, Merge statement is still one DCS of type Merge, even if it has Insert, Update, Delete inside.
You should ignore all the statements, that are not related to the operations, that do not change data in the tables.
'SELECT INTO <some_table> FROM ...' should be considered as INSERT.
You should also establish the relationships between the tables (views), been referenced in the statements,
 in terms of "target" - "source". 
You should also take into consideration the Common Table Expressions, - you need to de-compose them to source tables and views.
If there are some temporary tables been used in SP, - they should be considered similarly to CTE-s, 
- to work out dependencies, but they should not be included in the output.
We can have many source tables or views for one target table.

For output use format below:

{example}
Input SQL script: '{input_sql_script}'.
